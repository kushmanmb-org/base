# Applying Branch Protection Rulesets

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for applying the branch protection rulesets defined in this repository to the GitHub repository.

## Prerequisites

- Repository admin access to `kushmanmb-org/web`
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed (for API method)
- OR access to GitHub web interface

## Method 1: Using GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

### Step 1: Access Repository Settings

1. Navigate to https://github.com/kushmanmb-org/web
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. In the left sidebar, click **Rules** → **Rulesets**

### Step 2: Create Master Branch Protection Ruleset

1. Click **New branch ruleset**
2. Configure the following settings:

**General**
- Ruleset Name: `Master Branch Protection`
- Enforcement status: **Active**

**Target branches**
- Add target: `Include default branch` or specifically add `master`

**Branch protections**
- ✅ Restrict deletions
- ✅ Require linear history
- ✅ Require signed commits
- ✅ Require a pull request before merging
  - Required approvals: `1`
  - ✅ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
  - ✅ Require review from Code Owners
  - ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
  - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - Required checks: Add the following status checks:
    - `build`
    - `test`
    - `e2e`
    - `bearer`
    - `codeql`
- ✅ Block force pushes

**Bypass list**
- Add: `Repository admin` (for emergency situations only)

3. Click **Create** to save the ruleset

### Step 3: Create Release Branch Protection Ruleset

1. Click **New branch ruleset**
2. Configure similar to master, but:

**General**
- Ruleset Name: `Release Branch Protection`

**Target branches**
- Add target: `Include by pattern` → `release/*`

**Branch protections**
- Same as master branch, except:
  - Do NOT enable "Restrict deletions" (releases can be deleted after completion)

**Bypass list**
- Add: `Maintain role` or `Repository admin`

3. Click **Create**

### Step 4: Create Tag Protection Ruleset

1. Click **New tag ruleset**
2. Configure:

**General**
- Ruleset Name: `Tag Protection`
- Enforcement status: **Active**

**Target tags**
- Add target: `Include by pattern` → `v*`

**Tag protections**
- ✅ Restrict deletions
- ✅ Require signed tags

**Bypass list**
- Add: `Maintain role` or `Repository admin`

3. Click **Create**

## Method 2: Using GitHub CLI

If you have the GitHub CLI installed and authenticated:

### Step 1: Authenticate

```bash
gh auth login
```

### Step 2: Create Rulesets via API

```bash
# Navigate to the repository directory
cd /path/to/web

# Create master branch protection ruleset
gh api \
  --method POST \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  /repos/kushmanmb-org/web/rulesets \
  --input .github/rulesets/master-branch-protection.json

# Create release branch protection ruleset
gh api \
  --method POST \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  /repos/kushmanmb-org/web/rulesets \
  --input .github/rulesets/release-branch-protection.json

# Create tag protection ruleset
gh api \
  --method POST \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  /repos/kushmanmb-org/web/rulesets \
  --input .github/rulesets/tag-protection.json
```

### Step 3: Verify Rulesets

```bash
# List all rulesets
gh api /repos/kushmanmb-org/web/rulesets | jq '.[] | {id, name, target, enforcement}'
```

## Method 3: Using Terraform (For Infrastructure as Code)

If you're managing GitHub infrastructure with Terraform:

```hcl
# main.tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    github = {
      source  = "integrations/github"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "github" {
  owner = "kushmanmb-org"
}

resource "github_repository_ruleset" "master_protection" {
  repository = "web"
  name       = "Master Branch Protection"
  target     = "branch"
  enforcement = "active"

  conditions {
    ref_name {
      include = ["refs/heads/master"]
      exclude = []
    }
  }

  rules {
    deletion                = true
    non_fast_forward        = true
    required_linear_history = true
    required_signatures     = true

    pull_request {
      required_approving_review_count = 1
      dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push   = true
      require_code_owner_review       = true
      require_last_push_approval      = false
      required_review_thread_resolution = true
    }

    required_status_checks {
      strict_required_status_checks_policy = true
      required_check {
        context = "build"
      }
      required_check {
        context = "test"
      }
      required_check {
        context = "e2e"
      }
      required_check {
        context = "bearer"
      }
      required_check {
        context = "codeql"
      }
    }
  }

  bypass_actors {
    actor_id    = 5
    actor_type  = "RepositoryRole"
    bypass_mode = "always"
  }
}

# Add similar resources for release branches and tags
```

Then apply:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Verification

After applying the rulesets, verify they are working:

1. **Test Branch Protection**:
   ```bash
   # Try to push directly to master (should fail)
   git checkout master
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Test commit"
   git push origin master
   # Expected: Error - protected branch
   ```

2. **Test Pull Request Requirements**:
   - Create a test branch and PR
   - Verify that status checks are required
   - Verify that review is required
   - Try to merge without approval (should fail)

3. **Check Ruleset Status**:
   - Go to Settings → Rules → Rulesets
   - Verify all rulesets show as **Active**
   - Check that the correct branches/tags are targeted

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Status checks not appearing as required

**Solution**: Ensure the status check names exactly match what your workflows report. Check workflow files in `.github/workflows/` to verify job names.

### Issue: Can't push to master even with bypass permissions

**Solution**: Verify your user has the correct role assigned in the bypass list. Repository admins should be able to bypass when necessary.

### Issue: Rulesets conflict with existing branch protections

**Solution**: Remove old branch protection rules before applying rulesets. Go to Settings → Branches and delete any existing rules.

### Issue: API creation fails with authentication error

**Solution**: Ensure you have:
- Admin access to the repository
- Valid GitHub CLI authentication (`gh auth status`)
- Correct repository name and owner

## Maintenance

### Updating Rulesets

To update an existing ruleset:

1. **Via Web UI**: Navigate to Settings → Rules → Rulesets → Select ruleset → Edit
2. **Via API**: Use PATCH method with the ruleset ID
   ```bash
   gh api \
     --method PATCH \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
     /repos/kushmanmb-org/web/rulesets/{ruleset_id} \
     --input updated-ruleset.json
   ```

### Reviewing Ruleset Effectiveness

Periodically review:
- Number of bypass requests
- Failed merge attempts due to rules
- Developer feedback on workflow impact
- Security incidents prevented by rules
