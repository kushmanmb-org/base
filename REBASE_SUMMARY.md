# Dependabot PR Rebase Summary

## Task
Rebase Dependabot PR #30 "chore(deps): bump the npm_and_yarn group across 1 directory with 14 updates" onto the latest master branch.

## What was Done

### 1. Identified the Dependabot PR
- PR #30 was created by Dependabot on February 10, 2026
- Base commit: `14b6072c` (PR #67 - Merge pull request #67 from kushmanmb-org/copilot/update-key-tree-derivation)
- Dependabot commit: `21f6ea41` - bumps 14 npm packages

### 2. Identified the Latest Master
- Latest master commit: `c05cbf21` (PR #81 - Merge pull request #81 from kushmanmb-org/copilot/add-gasless-quote-request)
- This is 1 commit ahead of the Dependabot PR's base

### 3. Performed the Rebase
- Used `git cherry-pick` to apply the Dependabot commit onto the latest master
- Result: New commit `e7feeab0` with the same dependency updates, now based on latest master
- Auto-merged `package.json` successfully with no conflicts
